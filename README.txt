Carson Stabell,

First tutorial game for GoDot.
This seems to be a very versitile and flexible platform.
Team will have to discuss all the benifits of other platforms we have been individually testing.
However, I think what may tip the scales is the robust open source comunity for GoDot.
It contains and incredible ammount of examples and sample code that could speed the creation process immensely.
This would allow us to put a lot of effort into design, as well as potentially branching off one another and testing multiple different and/or conflicting ideas.
As multiplayer still stands the monolith of our game, being able to dedicate a lot of time and resources to it could be invaluable.
